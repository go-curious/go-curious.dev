I have been building software in some capacity for over a decade now, specifically enterprise software. When we think about enterprise software development, we picture beige offices full of equally beige and uninterested people but, I can appreciate these roles for what they are: abundant, stable, and even lucrative. You probably won’t be working with cutting-edge technology, or building hyper-scaled systems, but you can still have a great career and earn decent money doing it… perhaps even enjoy yourself at some point.

Unfortunately for me, I’ve reached a point where I need a change of scenery. I hit a rut in my career a couple of years ago and I still feel like I'm in a tailspin. The things that used to excite me about the industry no longer do that - .NET Core and Azure were my go-tos but nowadays I don't even bother keeping up with the releases- nothing interests me. I have been using .NET for the length of my career, and the community is still having the same stagnant debates about Dependency Injection and Unit Testing when the world outside of the .NET bubble has moved on.

# A new religion

I remember first hearing about Go: the shiny new language from Google with the cute mascot. It didn’t have classes or generics (back then) and was mainly used for building systems as opposed to business applications, so I ignored it. It wasn’t until a couple of years ago that I had the opportunity to write some Go during a company hackathon event. My team was tasked with rebuilding a legacy Python application using Google Cloud Functions and Go was our language of choice. Despite my being new to the language, I was amazed by how quickly I was able to pick it up, and the tooling was just incredible.

The simplicity of the language really resonated with me, especially coming from a "kitchen sink" language like C#. For example, if I need to iterate over something using Go, I just have `for` instead of in C# where I have `for`, `foreach`, `while` and `do while` - not to mention LINQ. Having a single idiomatic way of doing things is a more productive philosophy to language design. By taking choice out of the equation, we can focus on solving real problems instead of arguing over syntax.

Moving on from the language itself, the ecosystem surrounding Go is incredible. If I want to build a full-featured API, there are a multitude of different libraries and frameworks that I can use, though so far I’m partial to using the standard library. Of course, I can’t mention the ecosystem without mentioning the community behind it. 

Employability was a big factor when choosing a new language because there’s no point in learning a new language if only a handful of companies use it. Working in .NET, I can easily find work in just about any town or city and while Go doesn't have the same level of adoption as .NET, there are still plenty of jobs out there. The types of organizations that utilize Go excites me too: trendy startups, large tech companies, cloud-native tooling- the stuff I’ve always wanted to work on but couldn’t because nobody in the .NET world cared about it.

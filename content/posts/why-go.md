While writing the first post on a new blog, I find myself in a dilemma: do I jump straight into the subject or first take the time to introduce myself? In this situation, itâ€™s probably beneficial to understand my background and why I came to find Go as my savior.

I have been building software in some capacity for over a decade now, specifically enterprise software. When we think about enterprise software development, we picture beige offices full of equally beige and uninterested people, but I can appreciate these roles for what they are: abundant, stable and even lucrative. You probably won't be working with cutting edge technology, or building hyperscaled systems, but as long as you're happy building line-of-business applications you can have a great career and earn decent money doing it. You might even have fun while doing it too!

For me personally, I've reached a point where I need a change. I hit a rut in my career a couple of years ago and I just don't see my work in the same light anymore. I've tried working in different sized companies and sectors, but no matter where I go I end up running into boredom. The .NET community is still having the same tired debates about Dependency Injection and SOLID that it was when I first started in the industry, and don't get me started on the language bloat that C# has gone through in the last few years. **I need something new.**

## a new language

I remember hearing about Go when I first started working in tech: the shiny new language from Google with the cute mascot. It didn't have classes or generics, and was mainly used for building systems as opposed to business applications, so I ignored it. It wasn't until a couple of years ago that I had the opportunity to write some Go during a company hackathon event. My team was tasked with rebuilding a legacy Python application using Google Cloud Functions and Go was our language of choice. Despite me being new to the language, I was amazed by how quickly I was able to pick it up, and the tooling was the best I had ever encountered.

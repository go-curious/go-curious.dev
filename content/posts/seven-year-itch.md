I have been building software in some capacity for over a decade now, with 7 of those years as a Developer. I have worked on SaaS products, public-facing websites, back-office systems and most recently have turned my hand towards consultancy work, and generally speaking I've had a blast doing it. 

I have spent the length of my career writing C#, which I have found to be an absolute workhorse of a language, but like any relationship there comes a time where I find myself questioning if I'm still happy or just complacent. The answer is neither: **I'm unhappy**.

## The root of the problem

I have found myself growing increasingly disatisfied with the .NET ecosystem and it's reluctance to adopt anything not championed by Microsoft. Years have passed since Microsoft released the first open-source version of .NET, and despite initial enthusiasm about this being a new dawn for the .NET world - we're still just building our systems using whatever Microsoft gives us, and in ways that they tell us. 

For example: ASP.NET Core is the only viable web framework out there, and finding a company that uses anything but SQL Server for a database and Azure for hosting is worryingly rare. Even something as ubiqitous as containers isn't nearly as common as in other ecosystems. 

The .NET community has always felt like the red-headed step child of the wider developer community, and it's our own fault, because we're still treating Microsoft like our benevolent dictator, while we're having the same tired arguments about Dependency Injection and Unit Testing that the rest of the world moved on from years ago. To put it simply: I need to adapt my skillset before .NET becomes another COBOL, and I believe Go is a safe bet.

## So, why Go?

I remember first hearing about Go: the shiny new language from Google with the cute mascot. I initially dismissed it as a Google passion project that would be abandonware within a couple of years, and would never gain traction outside of Hacker News. Okay, I was incredibly wrong here, but you can't say Google [doesn't have a track record](https://killedbygoogle.com/).

It wasnâ€™t until a couple of years ago that I had the opportunity to write some Go during a company hackathon event. My team was tasked with rebuilding a legacy Python application using Google Cloud Functions and Go was our language of choice. Despite my being new to the language, I was amazed by how quickly I was able to pick it up, and the tooling was just incredible. 

### Simplicity

The language's simplicity and it's clear idioms meant that I was led into what we call [the pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/). A long-time complaint of mine is that C# has been gradually losing this quality with every release. Having so many different ways to approach a problem is nice on paper, but makes it code less predictable to write, or in other words makes the code less "boring". 

The language philosopy of Go is to emphasise "boring" code. No matter the size of the codebase you are looking at, you will see the language being written in the same way. There is no obsession with abstraction, and no patterns that some guys decided were a good idea 30 years ago- only boring Go code.

### The Job Market

Tech unicorns, trendy startups, cloud native tooling, high scale systems: all of them are using Go, and almost none of them are using .NET. I can appreciate your run-of-the-mill enterprise companies for what they are: stable, and the Microsoft ecosystem is fantastic for those use cases. 

I'm at a point in my career where I want to work on challenging problems, and moving over to Go will give me more of a chance to do this. There really is only a finite number of times that you can build an API that serves data to a dashboard and still enjoy it.

In a purely unrelated note, those kind of companies I mentioned above are also among the highest paying on the market, so that's nice...

## What's next?

I am now working in a role where I am surrounded by Go developers and reading Go code on a daily basis. I want to use this blog as an outlet for my learning and to immerse myself in the Go community. 

Now I've published a blog post, can I officially call myself a Gopher?
